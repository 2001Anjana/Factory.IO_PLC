Overview
The project simulates the bottle cap assembly process in a factory environment. It showcases an automated assembly line, controlled by a PLC (Programmable Logic Controller), using ladder logic programming.

**The main objectives of this simulation**:

To automate the assembly of bottle caps onto bottles.
To simulate a realistic factory environment for educational and testing purposes.
To control the process via a PLC, enhancing industrial automation skills.

**Tools Used**
Factory IO: For creating the factory simulation environment.
SIEMENS TIA Portal V16: For writing ladder logic and integrating with the PLC.
S7 PLCSIM V16: To simulate the PLC and test the logic without actual hardware.

**System Workflow**
Bottles move along the conveyor belt.
A sensor detects the arrival of each bottle.
The bottle is positioned under a capping station.
The cap is placed on the bottle, and the assembly process is completed.
The bottle is moved further for packaging or quality control.
